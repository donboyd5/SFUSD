# CAUTION -----------------------------------------------------------------
# Reading Microsoft Access files is tricky.

# you will need the package RODBC

# First, you have to load this program using 32-bit R because it reads MS ACCESS files.
# (Tools\Global options)
# Oddly, Microsoft has not provided the ability to read these files with 64-bit R.
# 64-bit R is fine for other programs after the Access files are converted.

# Second, the older .mdb Access files can be read using
#   odbcConnectAccess(fpath)
# where fpath is the full path (including file name) to the .mdb file.

# Third, oddly, the newer .accdb Access fles must be read using
#   odbcConnectAccess2007(fpath)
# where fpath is the full path (including file name) to the .accdb file.


# Notes -------------------------------------------------------------------

# download, extract, and convert the CDE (California Department of Education) J-90 data for multiple years
# Report of Teacher Salary and Benefit Data (Form J-90)

# NOTE: You must use 

# There is a little bit of documentation on the CDE site for the data, and I have downloaded various documents
# that give more. I have sent an email to CDE asking for the data collection form (J-90) and instructions
# but have not heard back yet.

# j90 information ---------------------------------------------------------

# TSAL117 File Contains information from sections I, III, IV, V, and VI of the J-90
# TSAL217 File Contains the text headings entered for each of the columns in the salary schedule, Section II
# TSAL317 File Contains the salary and FTEs for each column and salary in Section II
# Tsal417 File Contains the benefit information in Section VII
# TSAL517 File Contains the benefit information in Section VIII for retirees over 65
# TSAL617 File Contains the benefit information in Section VIII for retirees 65 and under

# TSAL517 and TSAL617 have essentially the same information. Here is TSAL617:
# County Two digit county code
# District Five digit district code
# CDS Seven digit combined code
# TS6_BenA one character code indicating type of benefit.  H for heath, D for dental, V for vision, L for life, O for other
# TS6_Desc The name of the plan
# TS6_Step The health benefit plans ID.  The first is always 1, the second and subsequent like plans are number consequently. This is calculated by the input program
# TS6_Column A column 1 is always Single, 2 is two party plan, 3 is family plan, 4 is composite rate
# TS6_Annual The annual cost of plan
# TS6_Contr The amount the district contributes to the cost of the plan
# TS6_FTE The number of retired teachers (age 65 or under) participating in the plan
# TS6_ID number that is generated when a J-90 is submitted. Each record has an ID number

# TS1_Maxcaf The maximum annual employer contributions to cafeteria plan.
# TS1_Maxsin The maximum annual employer contributions to single plan per employee.
# TS1_Maxtwo The maximum annual employer contributions to a two party plan per employee.
# TS1_Maxfam The maximum annual employer contributions to a family plan per employee.
# TS1_CAPTYPE Is the cap hard or soft or NA

# Ben_life	Does district cover retirees for life? (Y/N)
# Ben_stop	If not for life, when do benefits stop? Age or years
# H_plan	Number of Health plans
# D_plan	Number of dental plans
# V_plan	Number of vision plans
# L_plan	Number of life plans
# O_plan	Number of other plans


# County Two digit county code
# District Five digit district code
# CDS Seven digit combined code
# TS6_BenA one character code indicating type of benefit.  H for heath, D for dental, V for vision, L for life, O for other

# ms access notes ---------------------------------------------------------
# https://www.roelpeters.be/solved-importing-microsoft-access-files-accdb-mdb-in-r/
# If your tables arenâ€™t huge (+4GB), you can simply change R to the 32-bit version.

# https://newbedev.com/how-to-read-data-from-microsoft-access-accdb-database-files-into-r
# You may need to run the 32-bit c:\windows\sysWOW64\odbcad32.exe if running 64-bit Windows

# I (djb) examined alternative approaches but in the end concluded that the best thing to do
# is run this file with 32-bit R to extract and convert the files from MS Access, and do all
# subsequent analysis with 64-bit R.
